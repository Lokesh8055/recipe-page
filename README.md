## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- FlexBox

### What I learned

Learned about hiding and showing the image based on screen size

```css
.omelette__desktop {
  display: none;
}

.omelette__mobile {
  display: block;
}
```

### Continued development

Will continue my focus on responsive web design principles in next projects
